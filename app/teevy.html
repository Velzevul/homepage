        <p>One of my goals for this project was to improve my style of writing SASS. Before I was sticking to the SMACSS convention of code structuring (which I really like), but I started to notice that in different modules I use the same layout patterns, which ideally would be abstracted out into separate entities.</p>
        <p>Another challenge was to maintain clear separation between different modules in order to reduce naming conflicts without increasing the depth of applicability of selectors.</p>
        <p>Apart from that I wanted to learn how to work with Grunt task runner to automize the most common tasks: compilation of SASS, running local server, and autoreload.</p>
